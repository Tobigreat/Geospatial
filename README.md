Mapping Nigerian Market

## Tracking Nigerian Markets by Market Days
### Geospatial-Trade-Calendar Analysis Using R
This project focuses on the geospatial tracking of Nigerian market infrastructure based on market days, using R programming for spatial mapping and visualization. In many Nigerian communities, markets operate on fixed cyclical days (e.g., every 4 or 8 days), forming the backbone of local trade systems. By combining geographic coordinates with traditional trade calendars, the analysis provides a location-aware understanding of when and where markets operate. Leveraging tools like leaflet, sf, and dplyr in R, the project visualizes the spatial distribution of markets and aligns them with their active market days. This enables stakeholders to better plan logistics, resource distribution, and regional trade support initiatives.

### Problem Statement
Despite the cultural and economic importance of periodic markets in Nigeria, there is a lack of centralized data mapping market names to their operational days and locations. Without this visibility, traders, investors, and government agencies face challenges in synchronizing supply chains, market visits, and infrastructure planning. Traditional market schedules vary across regions and are often undocumented digitally, leading to missed opportunities for rural commerce optimization and strategic trade interventions. A geospatial approach is needed to capture both the location and timing of market operations.

### Objectives
1. Map Markets Geospatially by Name and Day: Use R’s spatial libraries to create interactive maps that visualize each market’s location and its respective trading day(s).

2. Improve Rural-Urban Supply Planning: Support vendors, transporters, and planners in aligning distribution schedules with known active market days to avoid inefficiencies.

N.B: This analysis was conducted using R programming, incorporating packages such as leaflet, sf, dplyr, and shiny. The interactive map presents Nigeria’s markets by name, supporting 
spatial-temporal exploration of traditional economic activity.
